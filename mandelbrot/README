-=- How to build and run the code -=-

(Note that this probably will not work outside of Windows.)

An OCL library is required to run the code. I found mine from a random Github release here:
- https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases

Godot 4.2 is required alongside Rust to run the project. I was not able to produce a working standalone application in time, so opening up the game in Godot 4.2 and setting it up with Rust is a requirement.

- https://godot-rust.github.io/book/intro/setup.html

After setting up rust, you'll want to run `cargo build` in the rust directory to set it up.

Open godot/project.godot in Godot 4.2, and you'll be able to run the game scene from the top-right. If the main screen renders with the Godot logo in-game (not in the editor), then there's been an issue with the Rust call to render the set.
