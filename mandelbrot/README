-=- How to build and run the code -=-

An OCL library is required to run the code. I found mine from a random Github release here:
- https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases

Godot 4.2 is required alongside Rust to run the project. I was not able to produce a working standalone application in time, so opening up the game in Godot 4.2 and setting it up with Rust is a requirement.

After setting up rust, you'll want to run `cargo build` in the rust directory to set it up.

This will probably not work out of Windows.
