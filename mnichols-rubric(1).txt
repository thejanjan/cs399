Notes: This sounds like a great project idea! You seem to have 
thought through all the possible problems you may run into, and 
have a good backup plan, so that's most of my concerns handled. I 
agree that OpenCL in Rust might be a lot to deal with all at once,
though it should work for your use case. After some quick searching,
I think either Rust-gpu or Rust-CUDA would work, though there would
be trade-offs. If Rust doesn't work out though, there are CUDA 
bindings for Python that you might be able to use? For the 
evaluation, you might consider adding FPS or something similar. 
While I agree that getting this working at all will be a challenge
unto itself, it's worth considering a metric for how *well* it's
working. I look forward to seeing your results!
