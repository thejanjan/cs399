load modules, run make, and then submit the sbatch.

here are the clauses and times i verified (sizes 10000):

1. no clauses: 699ms
2. gang outer, vector inner: 208ms
3. gang outer, worker inner: 213ms
4. worker outer, vector inner: 685ms

using the clauseless state as a control reference, #2 provided the largest speedup (and is recommended by openACC documentation, putting gang on outermost loops and vector on innermost). which makes it surprising that #3 had similar results (i don't have enough confidence in GPU viscera to hazard a guess here). #4 reveals that avoiding gang on the outer causes the gpu to throw a fit, providing practically no speedup whatsoever.
