load modules, run make, and then submit the sbatch.

with an n and m of 1000, my times were:

- A*B: 276ms
- A*B, transposed B: 21ms
- A*B, transposed A: 40ms

the performance difference when using a transposed matrix is pretty staggering.
when not using any transposed matrices, the sum operation for k involved the accesses of A[i][k]*B[k][j], which aren't aligned.
transposing them either way provides a substantial speedup, since the memory hops for each array access become equal.
it's best with a transposed B however, since that makes each float become adjacent to one another in memory.
